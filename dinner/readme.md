## Steps for preparation:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.

Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.

Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
